# Dereks-scheduler
## Description
This project already had some HTML and CSS so had to change the HTML and add JavaScript with Jquery and dayJs. The HTML I added data attributes to each div block changing to military time so the scheduler would know that 9am is less than 1pm in terms of the html id hour-9 not saying AM or PM. Made a if else loop so that when the current time changes on hte hour each block will change to the right color. Also added local storage so it will keep the information on the page in the present and future to read. I had some hard times with this getting words on paper, but Andres (tutor) helped me tweek some things to get the functions working. He also helped me find the right words on how to google things to make more sense. I am still learning every project I do and it's getting just slightly easier to make sense of the functions and variable and how they work together.
